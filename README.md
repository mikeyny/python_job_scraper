# Python Job Scraper

This project is part of a comprehensive tutorial on web scraping using Python. The tutorial guides you through the process of building a web scraper that collects job listings from the official [Python job board](https://www.python.org/jobs) and saves them into a CSV file.

## Overview

Web scraping is a powerful technique for extracting data from websites. In this project, you will learn how to:

- Set up a Python environment for web scraping.
- Use libraries such as `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` to fetch and parse HTML content.
- Extract relevant job details including job title, company name, location, posted date, and job link.
- Handle pagination to scrape multiple pages of job listings.
- Save the collected data into a CSV file for further analysis.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, ensure you have Python 3.11+ installed and run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the necessary packages.

To run the script to collect job listings simply run `python app.py`. The results will be saved in a file named `job_listings.csv`.
